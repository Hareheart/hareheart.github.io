    <h1>Animal Farm Recap</h1>
    <p>The story of Animal Farm isn't just an original story about animals starting a revolution. In fact, this is a story of communism based on real-life events in the Soviet Union.
The story is taken way back around the 1920s. At that time, the Soviet Union pictured a better world through communism, where everyone was equal, which represents the animals in Animal Farm's hope for a better world without Jones, the previous owner of the farm who treated the animals badly. However, the animals start a revolution that ends up in Jones leaving the farm in exile, representing the Soviet Revolution.</p>
<p>After this, the animals start working for their own benefit, and they went happily to bed with their stomachs full. In the process, however, two pigs called Snowball and Napoleon begin to disagree with each other. This represents the disagreement between Stalin and Trotsky, who were the two people in the Soviet Union during the Russian Revolution. Their disagreement ends up with Trotsky having to flee from Russia after Stalin sent him in exile, which happens in the book to, as Snowball is sent in exile after Napoleon disagrees with him for building a windmill, which he said would be useless and just extra unnecessary work. (He later says that the windmill is a great idea and that the animals should work harder to build it, so... whatever). </p>
<p>After Snowball was kicked out, Napoleon gradually became a dictator (with the pigs help, and also the dogs who he trained himself), which led to the animals working harder and harder for the pigs' benefit. Slowly through the story, the pigs take control of everything and starts to become like Jones, and that point is shown by the end of the book, where the pigs sell Boxer, a loyal and strong horse, to the butcher and use the money on alchohol, which they had been addicted to. They also started to use Jones' clothes and sleep in his beds, which was considered illegal as the animals had made a rule on that which stated that this was not allowed.</p>
<p>The book ends with the animals discovering a meeting with other humans, the leaders of neighbor farms, and the pigs, and Napoleon declares that his farm should now be called "Manor Farm" and the people start to play cards. In the card game, however, two people put the same card on the table (this is considered cheating as each and every card in a deck of cards is unique, and having two of the same card is impossible) and they all start arguing. The book now ends with the line: “The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.”</p>
