    <h2>My Computer's History</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I got my computer a couple of years ago from my grandfather, and I think it's a great computer. It's RAM storage is relatively large, the ports are useful, and it allows me to browse quickly, making it effective for schoolwork. I like that it's quick to use and useful in many aspects.</li>
        <li>What drains the power of a computer is the amount of tabs you have open; the more tabs you have, the more storage the system has to keep running, thus making it slower.</li>
        <li>Special activities that slows down a computer are large activities like video games that have large files which takes more space, making the computer go slower.</li>
    </ul>
